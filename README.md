# vue-todo-app

This is my personal Vue project based on the well-known to-do, but in order to somehow complicate the task and add some features, it was decided to use some libraries (the list of which will be given below), the ability to add up to 5 categories and switch between them in the main menu , task progress counter and much more.

Used technologies: 

  - Vue 3 (Composition API)
  - Element-Plus
  - Vuex

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
